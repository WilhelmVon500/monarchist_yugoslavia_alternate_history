Somehow, both the Communists and Center are at the very least willing to entertain negotiations. Of course, KPD radicals and Center conservatives derail the negotiations almost immediately. The KPD demands leadership of the coalition for themselves and their chairman Ernst Thälmann, [? if spd_r > kpd_r : despite our higher vote share, ?]while the Center is offended by the prospect of helping Bolsheviks enter government. *Something* must be done to restore balance.

In response to the KPD's entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that the Popular Front government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and center and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

The KPD has taken an abstentionist position with regards to ministries. They claim to be participating as the "loyal opposition" within the Popular Front government, supporting us from the outside while also running their own propaganda campaigns to turn workers to their side. They seem to expect that the Popular Front would inevitably fail, and that our failure would benefit them.

The Center manages to diffuse some of the hostility from the Reichswehr and the Stahlhelm, but fail to prevent the outbreak of fighting. We are forced to fight on the same side as the KPD, whether we want to or not.

The KPD is still very reluctant to join a coalition, despite grassroots friendliness between our memberships. The Stalinist leadership is vehemently against such a thing. They demand the appointment of Ernst Thälmann as chancellor in exchange for a coalition. [? if president == "Hindenburg" : There is no chance whatsoever that President Hindenburg would approve of the appointment of a die-hard communist as chancellor. ?] Alternatively, if our relations with them are good enough, we could convince them to support the appointment of one of our centrist or left-leaning members as chancellor.
