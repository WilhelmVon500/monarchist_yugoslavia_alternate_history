Somehow, both the Communists and Center are at the very least willing to entertain negotiations. Of course, KPD radicals and Center conservatives derail the negotiations almost immediately. The KPD demands leadership of the coalition for themselves and their chairman Ernst Thälmann, [? if spd_r > kpd_r : despite our higher vote share, ?]while the Center is offended by the prospect of helping Bolsheviks enter government. *Something* must be done to restore balance.

In response to the KPD's entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that the Popular Front government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and center and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

The KPD has taken an abstentionist position with regards to ministries. They claim to be participating as the "loyal opposition" within the Popular Front government, supporting us from the outside while also running their own propaganda campaigns to turn workers to their side. They seem to expect that the Popular Front would inevitably fail, and that our failure would benefit them.

- @ministries: First, we must select our ministries.


@popular_front_civil_war
on-arrival: kpd_relation = 80; reichswehr_loyalty += 0.25;

In response to the KPD's entrance into the government, the right-wing immediately launches a coup attempt. Troops of the Stahlhelm and Nazi SA enter Berlin and immediately begin clashing with our supporters! Reactionary officers within the Reichswehr have taken their troops out of the barracks and joined them with the Stahlhelm to stop us from taking power.

The Center manages to diffuse some of the hostility from the Reichswehr and the Stahlhelm, but fail to prevent the outbreak of fighting. We are forced to fight on the same side as the KPD, whether we want to or not.

@left_coalition_possible

The KPD is still very reluctant to join a coalition, despite grassroots friendliness between our memberships. The Stalinist leadership is vehemently against such a thing. They demand the appointment of Ernst Thälmann as chancellor in exchange for a coalition. [? if president == "Hindenburg" : There is no chance whatsoever that President Hindenburg would approve of the appointment of a die-hard communist as chancellor. ?] Alternatively, if our relations with them are good enough, we could convince them to support the appointment of one of our centrist or left-leaning members as chancellor.

With great reluctance, President [+ president +] appoints [+ chancellor +] as chancellor.

Immediately, [+ chancellor +] goes to work building a "Soviet Germany": consolidating as much power as possible in the KPD, purging state institutions of anti-communists, and sending street fighters against the "enemies of the people".

In response to [+ chancellor +] being appointed Chancellor, the right-wing forces launches almost immediately launch an attempted coup. Troops of the Stahlhelm and Nazi SA enter Berlin and immediately begin clashing with our supporters! Reactionary officers within the Reichswehr have taken their troops out of the barracks and joined them with the Stahlhelm to stop the KPD from taking power. We are forced to be on the same side as the KPD, whether we want to or not.

Somehow, surprisingly, the left coalition is successfully formed, without appointing Thälmann as chancellor. The consensus choice for chancellor, accepted by the SPD, KPD, and President [+ president +], is Rudolf Breitscheid, who belongs to the centrist faction of the SPD, but was acceptable to the left due to his previous membership in the left-wing anti-war USPD.

In response to the KPD's entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that our government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

The KPD has taken an abstentionist position with regards to ministries. They claim to be participating as the "loyal opposition" in the worker's government, supporting us from the outside while also running their own propaganda campaigns to turn workers to their side. They seem to expect that we would inevitably fail, and that our failure would benefit them. 

Whatever their reasoning is, the SPD has control over the ministries of government.

However, the DNVP and its leader Hugenberg is refusing to partake in a coalition with the "November criminals" in the Center Party. Thus, there is no clear path towards a Reichstag majority.

Even though the DNVP is very reluctant to participate in such a coalition, they still accede to President Hindenburg's wishes. Thus, a majority center-right coalition is formed, with Brüning as chancellor.
